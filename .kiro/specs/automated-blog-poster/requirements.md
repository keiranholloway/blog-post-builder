# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The automated blog poster is a system that allows users to input raw blog post ideas through text or voice input, processes and refines that content using AI, and automatically publishes polished blog posts to various platforms. The system aims to streamline the content creation workflow by transforming rough ideas into publication-ready content with minimal manual intervention.

5. IF voice input fails THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and offer a simple retry option
6. WHEN the interface loads THEN it SHALL be optimized for mobile use with large, touch-friendly controls
7. WHEN using the system THEN the entire process from voice input to published blog SHALL require minimal user interaction

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to hand over my raw ideas to a specialized AI agent, so that the agent can create a full blog post using my background and writing style context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN raw content is submitted THEN the system SHALL pass the content to a specialized AI agent with access to user background and writing style context
2. WHEN the AI agent receives the content THEN it SHALL create a complete blog post draft including title, introduction, body sections, and conclusion
3. WHEN the AI agent completes processing THEN the system SHALL receive the finessed blog post draft
4. IF the AI agent processing fails THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide options to retry or edit manually
5. WHEN the draft is created THEN the system SHALL maintain the original intent while applying the user's established writing style and voice
6. WHEN the blog post draft is complete THEN the system SHALL trigger an image generation agent to create an associated image for the post

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to review the AI agent's draft in a browser on any device, so that I can conveniently review content wherever I am.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI agent's draft is ready THEN the system SHALL make it accessible via web browser on both mobile and desktop
2. WHEN a user accesses the review page THEN the system SHALL display the draft in a readable format optimized for the device
3. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive interface that works well on small screens
4. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the system SHALL utilize the larger screen space effectively
5. IF the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL require secure login before showing the draft

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want an AI agent to generate suitable images for my blog posts using MCP servers, so that every post has compelling visual content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a blog post draft is created THEN the system SHALL invoke an image generation agent
2. WHEN the image generation agent receives the blog post content THEN it SHALL analyze the content to determine appropriate image concepts
3. WHEN image concepts are determined THEN the agent SHALL use MCP servers to generate AI images that complement the blog post
4. WHEN image generation is complete THEN the system SHALL associate the generated image with the blog post
5. IF image generation fails THEN the system SHALL retry with alternative prompts or notify the user
6. WHEN the image is ready THEN it SHALL be included in the review process alongside the blog post content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to provide feedback on both the AI agent's draft and generated image, and have them revised multiple times, so that I can iteratively improve the content until it meets my standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing a draft THEN the system SHALL display both the blog post content and associated image for review
2. WHEN feedback is provided THEN the system SHALL send the feedback back to the appropriate agents (content or image) for revision
3. WHEN agents complete revisions THEN the system SHALL present the updated content and/or image for review
4. IF multiple revision rounds are needed THEN the system SHALL support unlimited feedback cycles for both content and images
5. WHEN providing feedback THEN the system SHALL allow both general comments and specific feedback for content and images separately
6. WHEN a revision is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain a history of previous versions and feedback for both content and images

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to publish my finalized blog posts with images to multiple platforms using specialized agents, so that I can reach my audience across different channels with platform-optimized content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content and image are approved and ready for publishing THEN the system SHALL display available publishing platforms including Medium, LinkedIn, and other configured platforms
2. WHEN platforms are selected THEN the system SHALL delegate to specialized publishing agents for each platform
3. WHEN publishing agents receive content THEN they SHALL format and optimize both the content and image appropriately for their specific platform
4. WHEN publishing is triggered THEN the system SHALL coordinate with multiple publishing agents to post content with images simultaneously
5. IF publishing fails on any platform THEN the system SHALL report the specific failure and allow retry for that platform
6. WHEN publishing is successful THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation and links to published posts from each platform
7. WHEN new platforms are needed THEN the system SHALL support adding new publishing agents without code changes to the core system

### Requirement 7
