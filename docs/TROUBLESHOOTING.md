## Common Issues and Solutions

### Voice Recording Problems

#### Recording Button Not Working
**Symptoms**: Tap the voice button but nothing happens, no visual feedback

**Causes & Solutions**:
1. **Microphone permissions denied**
   - **Chrome/Edge**: Click the microphone icon in the address bar, select "Allow"
   - **Safari**: Go to Settings > Safari > Camera & Microphone > Allow
   - **Firefox**: Click the shield icon, enable microphone access

2. **Browser compatibility**
   - **Supported**: Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 11+, Edge 79+
   - **Not supported**: Internet Explorer, older mobile browsers
   - **Solution**: Update browser or try a different one

3. **HTTPS requirement**
   - **Problem**: Voice recording requires secure connection
   - **Solution**: Ensure you're accessing via HTTPS, not HTTP

#### Poor Audio Quality
**Symptoms**: Transcription is inaccurate, lots of "[inaudible]" in text

**Solutions**:
1. **Environment**
   - Find a quiet room away from traffic, air conditioning, or background noise
   - Close windows and doors to reduce external sounds
   - Turn off fans, TVs, or music

2. **Device positioning**
   - Hold device 6-8 inches from your mouth
   - Speak directly toward the microphone
   - Don't cover the microphone with your hand

3. **Speaking technique**
   - Speak clearly and at normal pace (not too fast or slow)
   - Use natural pauses between sentences
   - Avoid filler words like "um," "uh," "like"

#### Recording Cuts Off Early
**Symptoms**: Recording stops before you finish speaking

**Causes & Solutions**:
1. **Storage space**
   - **Check**: Device storage and browser storage limits
   - **Solution**: Free up space, clear browser cache

2. **Network issues**
   - **Problem**: Poor connection interrupts upload
   - **Solution**: Move closer to WiFi router, try cellular data

3. **Browser limits**
   - **Problem**: Some browsers limit recording duration
   - **Solution**: Keep recordings under 3 minutes, break into segments

### Content Generation Issues

#### Generated Content Doesn't Match Your Style
**Symptoms**: Blog post sounds generic, doesn't reflect your voice

**Solutions**:
1. **Provide style feedback**
   - Use the feedback form to describe your preferred tone
   - Examples: "More casual," "Professional but friendly," "Technical depth"
   - Include examples of your previous writing

2. **Give context in recordings**
   - Mention your target audience: "I'm writing for developers"
   - State your expertise level: "I'm a beginner explaining to other beginners"
   - Include your perspective: "From my experience as a startup founder"

3. **Iterative improvement**
   - The AI learns from your feedback over multiple posts
   - Be specific: "Too formal" vs "Use more contractions and casual language"
   - Approve content that matches your style to reinforce learning

#### Content Generation Fails
**Symptoms**: Error message, no content generated, stuck processing

**Solutions**:
1. **Input quality**
   - **Check**: Audio transcription for accuracy
   - **Fix**: Re-record if transcription is poor
   - **Alternative**: Use text input with clear, structured ideas

2. **Content length**
   - **Problem**: Very short input (under 30 seconds) may not generate full posts
   - **Solution**: Provide more detail, aim for 1-3 minutes of content

3. **Technical issues**
   - **Retry**: Wait 5 minutes and try again
   - **Check**: System status page for known issues
   - **Contact**: Support if problem persists

#### Generated Images Don't Match Content
**Symptoms**: Image seems unrelated to blog post topic

**Solutions**:
1. **Provide image feedback**
   - Use the image feedback form to describe what you want
   - Be specific: "Show a person coding" vs "More technical"
   - Mention style preferences: "Professional," "Colorful," "Minimalist"

2. **Include visual cues in recording**
   - Mention key visual concepts while recording
   - Describe your ideal image: "I'm thinking of a diagram showing..."
   - Reference specific objects, settings, or concepts

### Publishing Problems

#### Platform Authentication Expired
**Symptoms**: "Authentication failed" when trying to publish

**Solutions**:
1. **Reconnect platform**

#### Publishing Fails on Specific Platform
**Symptoms**: Publishes successfully to some platforms but fails on others

**Solutions**:
1. **Content guidelines**
