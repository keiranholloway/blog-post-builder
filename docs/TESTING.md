# Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Automated Blog Poster system, including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, performance tests, and deployment validation.

## Testing Architecture

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual components and functions in isolation
2. **Integration Tests** - Test interactions between components and services
3. **End-to-End Tests** - Test complete user workflows from start to finish
4. **Performance Tests** - Test system performance under various load conditions
5. **Security Tests** - Test authentication, authorization, and data protection
6. **Deployment Tests** - Validate deployments and infrastructure

### Test Environments

- **Local Development** - Individual developer machines
- **Staging** - Pre-production environment for integration testing
- **Production** - Live environment with production data (limited testing)

## Frontend Testing

### Unit Tests

Located in: `frontend/src/**/__tests__/*.test.ts`

```bash
# Run all frontend unit tests
cd frontend && npm run test:unit

# Run tests in watch mode
cd frontend && npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
cd frontend && npm run test:coverage
```

**Test Structure:**
- Component tests using React Testing Library
- Hook tests using React Hooks Testing Library
- Service tests with mocked dependencies
- Utility function tests

**Example Test:**
```typescript
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import VoiceRecorder from '../VoiceRecorder';

describe('VoiceRecorder', () => {
  it('starts recording when button is clicked', async () => {
    const onRecordingStart = vi.fn();
    render(<VoiceRecorder onRecordingStart={onRecordingStart} />);
    
    const recordButton = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /start recording/i });
    await fireEvent.click(recordButton);
    
    expect(onRecordingStart).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Tests

1. **Follow AAA Pattern** - Arrange, Act, Assert
2. **Use Descriptive Names** - Test names should explain what is being tested
3. **Keep Tests Independent** - Tests should not depend on each other
4. **Mock External Dependencies** - Use mocks for external services
5. **Test Edge Cases** - Include error conditions and boundary values

### Test Maintenance

1. **Regular Review** - Review and update tests regularly
2. **Remove Obsolete Tests** - Delete tests for removed features
3. **Update Test Data** - Keep test data current and relevant
4. **Monitor Test Performance** - Ensure tests run efficiently

### Continuous Improvement

1. **Analyze Test Results** - Look for patterns in failures
2. **Optimize Slow Tests** - Improve test execution time
3. **Increase Coverage** - Add tests for uncovered code
4. **Automate More Testing** - Reduce manual testing overhead

## Troubleshooting

### Common Test Failures

1. **MediaRecorder API Issues**
   ```typescript
   // Mock MediaRecorder for tests
   Object.defineProperty(window, 'MediaRecorder', {
     writable: true,
     value: vi.fn().mockImplementation(() => mockMediaRecorder),
   });
   ```

2. **Async Operation Timeouts**
   ```typescript
   // Use proper wait conditions
   await waitFor(() => {
     expect(screen.getByText(/expected text/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
   }, { timeout: 10000 });
   ```

3. **AWS Service Mocking**
   ```typescript
   // Use aws-sdk-client-mock
   const dynamoMock = mockClient(DynamoDBClient);
   dynamoMock.resolves({ Items: [] });
   ```

### Getting Help

- Check test documentation in individual test files
- Review GitHub Actions logs for CI/CD issues
- Consult team knowledge base for common solutions
- Create issues for persistent test failures
