Whilst I did recently recertify my AWS Security Specialty exam, I’ve not really done much study for AWS certification. In the past week, I recently shifted my focus to the Solution Architecture exams. As a warm-up, I first tackled the SA Associate certification — but was it worth it? <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Read on!</strong></p><figure name="ef07" id="ef07" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*_YiYdXH6sBhS-OBfi_b3GQ.png" data-width="250" data-height="252" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_YiYdXH6sBhS-OBfi_b3GQ.png"></figure><p name="055e" id="055e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I must confess, my initial thoughts on AWS recertification were laced with a healthy dose of skepticism. The idea of shelling out more money to rehash what I believed to be old news seemed like a clever ruse by Amazon to keep my wallet on a string. Yet, as I journeyed through the recertification process, I discovered it was less about Amazon filling their coffers and more about filling the gaps in my AWS knowledge. It was an opportunity to dive into the platform’s evolving landscape and get hands-on with tools that were either nascent or nonexistent during my last certification. For instance, understanding the intricate capabilities of the AWS Network Firewall wasn’t just a box-ticking exercise; it was a deep dive into security excellence. There’s a silver lining to this cloud (pun intended), and it’s worth exploring the myriad benefits that AWS recertification can bring to professionals like myself who may have been initially cynical.</p><h4 name="c035" id="c035" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Keeping Pace with Cloud Evolution</h4><p name="54c2" id="54c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an ever-morphing entity, frequently updated with new features and services. Recertification becomes a conduit to not only refresh one’s existing knowledge but also to get acquainted with the latest advancements. Take the AWS Network Firewall, for instance, a service that was perhaps a mere blueprint or a rudimentary feature during your initial certification days. Now, it’s a robust service that can shape your network’s security posture. Recertification opens up the avenue to learn about these innovations, ensuring that your skills are relevant and aligned with current industry standards.</p><h4 name="45be" id="45be" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Staying Ahead in Security Practices</h4><p name="5cc5" id="5cc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Security in the cloud is not a static concept. It is an ongoing battle with new threats emerging daily. AWS recertification puts security best practices at the forefront, compelling professionals to stay ahead of the curve. What was considered secure a year ago might now be a vulnerability waiting to be exploited. By recertifying, you get to grips with the newest security protocols and learn how to implement them effectively within your infrastructure.</p><h4 name="ab69" id="ab69" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Bridging the Knowledge Gap</h4><p name="571b" id="571b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">There is a significant difference between knowing a platform and mastering it. AWS recertification bridges the knowledge gap, transforming superficial understanding into deep expertise. It nudges you to learn about less-known services and features, expanding your AWS repertoire. This process ensures that you are not just re-learning what you already know but also fortifying your expertise with new insights and skills.</p><h4 name="f11c" id="f11c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Rediscovering AWS — through Hands-On Experience</h4><p name="17ef" id="17ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">AWS certifications aren’t just about passing an exam; they often involve hands-on labs and real-world scenario testing. Recertification reacquaints you with this practical side of AWS. You don’t just understand the theory; you can apply it effectively. This hands-on experience is invaluable, making you more competent and comfortable with the AWS ecosystem.</p><h4 name="8b8e" id="8b8e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Conclusion</h4><p name="89ee" id="89ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing">While I entered the recertification process with a degree of cynicism, it wasn’t long before I realized its intrinsic value. AWS recertification isn’t just a monetary transaction; it’s an investment in yourself and your professional future. It’s about staying relevant, secure, and ahead in the fast-paced realm of cloud services. So, if you find yourself questioning the merit of recertifying, consider the manifold benefits — from mastering new features like the AWS Network Firewall to adopting the latest security best practices. In the dynamic cloud environment, such an investment is not just beneficial; it’s essential.</p></div></div></section><section name="aa00" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="6d5e" id="6d5e" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing">Before you go — if you’ve got this far you’ve hopefully seen some value in this article.
