If you’re using them for technical documentation, you’re doing it wrong. Let me tell you why.</p><p name="83a2" id="83a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First of all, have you ever tried to format a Word document? It’s like trying to juggle flaming swords while riding a unicycle. You spend hours fiddling with margins, fonts, and line spacing, only to have it all go to hell when you try to print it out. And don’t even get me started on the nightmare that is adding images or tables.</p><p name="72c1" id="72c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But it’s not just the formatting that’s the problem. Word documents are also a nightmare to collaborate on. Every time you make a change, you have to save a new version, which means keeping track of different versions of the same document. It’s like trying to herd cats. And if you’re working on a team, forget about it. You’ll spend more time emailing different versions back and forth than actually getting any work done.</p><p name="e25a" id="e25a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Storing word documents is a nightmare too — there is nothing worse then when you have a system on fire to find a share-point repository with 249 files with obscure (if not, downright unhelpful) names… You also need to consider the overhead of opening up these files. Each one may only take 5 seconds but this is nothing short of painful when you’re time poor!</p><p name="acaf" id="acaf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Searching for specific content across multiple documents is borderline impossible!</p><p name="af05" id="af05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Documentation is rarely considered a glamourous job (sorry fellow authors!), everything should be done to make it easier and lowing the barrier to entry. Needing to fire up a heavy-weight client like Microsoft Word is only going to creating more friction at the starting gates. Not to mention — word documents often encourage having multiple sources of truth which is the source of all evil!</p><p name="8963" id="8963" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, let’s talk about wikis. Ah, sweet, sweet wikis. The ultimate documentation tool. First of all, they’re collaborative. That means that you can have multiple people working on the same document simultaneously without having to worry about version control. You can even see who made what changes and when they made them. It’s like having your very own team of documentation elves.</p><p name="91dd" id="91dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And let’s not forget about how easy it is to format wikis. Need to add a table? Just click a button. Want to insert an image? Piece of cake. Want to add a link to another page? Just type it in. It’s so easy, a monkey could do it.</p><p name="7798" id="7798" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In conclusion, if you’re still using Word documents for technical documentation, you’re doing it wrong. Wikis are the way to go. They’re collaborative, easy to format, and they’ll save you a lot of time and headaches. So, put down that Word document and start using wikis. Your documentation will thank you for it.</p><p name="797a" id="797a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Before you go — if you’ve got this far you’ve hopefully seen some value in this article. I write and publish this content free of charge. The cost for reading it though? Please like the article and click follow me — <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Think of this as a gentlemen’s agreement. The cost is nothing finacial just a token of appreciation for the time taken to put this together. Thank you.</strong></p></div></div></section>
