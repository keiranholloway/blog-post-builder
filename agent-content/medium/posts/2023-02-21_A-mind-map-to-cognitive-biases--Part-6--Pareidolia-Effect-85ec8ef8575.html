Or maybe you’ve seen the face on your toast? If so, then you might be a victim of pareidolia — a cognitive bias that makes us see patterns where there are none.</p><p name="91af" id="91af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pareidolia is the tendency to perceive a meaningful image or pattern in a random or vague stimulus. This phenomenon can occur in various forms, such as seeing faces in inanimate objects or hearing messages in music played backwards. It’s a pretty wacky phenomenon, and it can make us feel like we’re living in a world filled with secret messages and hidden meanings.</p><p name="9090" id="9090" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One common example of pareidolia in is the famous “face on Mars” phenomenon. In 1976, NASA’s Viking 1 spacecraft captured an image of the surface of Mars that showed what appeared to be a human face staring back at us. The image caused a lot of excitement at the time and sparked many conspiracy theories about the possibility of intelligent life on Mars.</p><p name="9ed4" id="9ed4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, as it turned out, the “face” was just a natural rock formation that happened to look like a face from a certain angle. But that didn’t stop people from continuing to see faces on Mars — or in other planets, for that matter.</p><p name="074b" id="074b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In fact, the phenomenon of pareidolia is so common that it has become a bit of a running joke in the world of tech. Engineers and designers have been known to hide hidden images and Easter eggs in their products to see if anyone will notice them. For example, some versions of Microsoft Excel had a hidden flight simulator game, while Google Maps has been known to include secret messages and images in its satellite images.</p><p name="1d44" id="1d44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So next time you think you see a message from the universe in your morning coffee or a familiar face in a random object, don’t worry — it’s just your brain playing tricks on you. And who knows, maybe there really is a secret message hidden in that cloud or that piece of toast — but more likely, it’s just pareidolia.</p><p name="9cea" id="9cea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Techniques for avoiding Pareidolia…</strong></p><p name="6140" id="6140" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Preventing pareidolia altogether may be difficult as it is a natural tendency of the human brain to try to find patterns and meaning in what we see or hear. However, there are some things you can do to reduce the impact of pareidolia and avoid jumping to conclusions based on false perceptions:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="04e2" id="04e2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Be aware of pareidolia:</strong> Recognizing that pareidolia is a natural tendency can help you be more conscious of your perceptions and less likely to jump to conclusions based on false patterns.</li><li name="ea1b" id="ea1b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Verify your perceptions:</strong> If you see or hear something that you think might be a pattern or message, try to verify it with other people or objective evidence.</li><li name="c8fc" id="c8fc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Use critical thinking:</strong> Don’t accept patterns or messages at face value. Instead, use critical thinking to evaluate the evidence and come to a rational conclusion.</li><li name="b2f4" id="b2f4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Take breaks:</strong> If you find yourself becoming fixated on a particular pattern or message, take a break and come back to it later with fresh eyes.</li><li name="2358" id="2358" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Seek expert opinion:</strong> If you’re unsure about a particular perception or pattern, seek out the opinion of experts in the relevant field, who may be able to provide a more informed perspective.</li></ol><p name="39b7" id="39b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">By being aware of the phenomenon of pareidolia and taking steps to verify your perceptions and use critical thinking, you can reduce the impact of this cognitive bias on your decision-making and avoid jumping to conclusions based on false patterns or messages.</p><p name="b5e2" id="b5e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Before you go — if you’ve got this far you’ve hopefully seen some value in this article.
