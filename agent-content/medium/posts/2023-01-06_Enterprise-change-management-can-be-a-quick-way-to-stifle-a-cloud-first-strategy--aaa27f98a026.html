In my experience working across various roles and observing the internal operations of businesses of all sizes, I have found that enterprise-level customers often struggle to effectively manage change within the cloud, particularly when operating in regulated environments. This ultimately results in customers failing to unlock the full potential of their hyperscalers, including AWS, Azure, and GCP.</p><p name="4ceb" id="4ceb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The cloud gives organizations superpowers, enabling them to innovate and run faster than ever before. However, this benefit is quickly squandered when traditional change management processes are adopted. Agile’s mantra of “release early and release often” falls flat when organizations are tied up behind a weekly CAB process, especially when waiting for a CTO’s sign-off.</p><p name="3711" id="3711" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So why is this so hard? Development teams are becoming larger and often operate within silos. This trade-off, which grants developers autonomy to build their own microservices and use their preferred languages, can make it harder to understand the implications of a change. Applications are also becoming more distributed and complex. Event-driven architecture with loose coupling can help, but does the CAB understand this?</p><p name="d39e" id="d39e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ten years ago, security was the harbinger of “no.” AWS has a good approach to this issue by baking security into each team and making it a day-zero task. Is this possible with change management as well? Multiple layers of change are standard operating procedure for enterprises, but the final approver often lacks context. How can this be fixed at scale?</p><p name="18b8" id="18b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What steps can organizations take to balance change with innovation and continue to unlock the benefits of the cloud?</p><p name="45ef" id="45ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Before you go — if you’ve got this far you’ve hopefully seen some value in this article.
