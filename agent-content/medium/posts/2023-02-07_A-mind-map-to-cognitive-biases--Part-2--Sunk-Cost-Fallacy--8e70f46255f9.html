This type of decision-making is often driven by a fear of wasting resources or an emotional attachment to the project.</p><p name="d58d" id="d58d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To provide a personal example, have you ever started watching a movie that wasn’t very good? After 15 minutes, you think, “This isn’t a good movie, but I’ve already invested some time into it, I’ll give it another 15 minutes.” After 30 minutes, you’re further in, so you don’t want to stop watching because you’ve already invested that time and you might as well finish it now. Before you know it, you’ve just spend 2 hours watching something which was completely unfulfilling. The alternative being you stopped watching after 15minutes and put on something which was truely enjoyable. This — is sunk cost fallacy. And it affect technical decisions too!</p><p name="5671" id="5671" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a technical project, the sunk cost fallacy can impact the project in several ways:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="9b19" id="9b19" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Inefficient allocation of resources:</strong> If a project is not progressing well, continuing to invest resources in it rather than cutting losses and redirecting resources to a more promising project can result in the inefficient allocation of resources and negatively impact the overall success of the project.</li><li name="b9d2" id="b9d2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Delayed decision-making:</strong> The sunk cost fallacy can cause individuals or teams to delay making a decision to end a project, resulting in additional time and resources being wasted on a project that is unlikely to produce a positive outcome.</li><li name="75fb" id="75fb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Missed opportunities:</strong> By continuing to invest resources in a failing project, a team may miss opportunities to redirect resources towards more promising projects, which could result in missed opportunities for growth and success.</li><li name="ad4c" id="ad4c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Reduced motivation</strong>: If individuals or teams feel that their resources are being wasted on a failing project, their motivation and morale can be negatively impacted, which can further impact the success of the project.</li></ol><p name="4c23" id="4c23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How this affect decision making…</strong></p><p name="e5b1" id="e5b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Humans can attach too much value to activities that they’re emotionally and personally invested in. This means that they consider the cost, time or resources they’ve already invested in a situation is much more valuable then the additional time required to complete a project.</p><p name="44b7" id="44b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This can lead to irrational decisions as individuals feel compelled to continue pursuing a course of action even if it is no longer rational or the best option. This bias can cause individuals to make decisions that are not in their best interest, as they are reluctant to abandon the investment they have already made, even if it would be more rational to cut their losses and move on to a more promising opportunity. In this way, the sunk cost fallacy can negatively impact decision making by hindering individuals from objectively evaluating their options and making the best decision for their future.</p><p name="266e" id="266e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Example of this within a technical setting…</strong></p><p name="c1c0" id="c1c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Imagine that you are a technology company that has a home-grown ticketing system that has become monolithic over the years. It was initially just used for customer requests, but over time, additional functionality such as change management, error databases, customer relationship management, and asset management have been added. However, the system is outdated and based on old technology with little to no integration with current tools. Making changes to the system is difficult and consumes a lot of engineering effort. Despite this, continuing to develop and invest in the legacy system becomes tempting due to the sunk cost fallacy, even though replacing some of these systems would yield better results, improved user experience, and better customer engagement.</p><p name="6e2a" id="6e2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Techniques for avoiding sun cost fallacy…</strong></p><ol class="postList"><li name="8c56" id="8c56" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Reframe the decision when working with long-running projects or systems:</strong> Instead of focusing on the resources already invested, shift the focus to future potential outcomes and the best decision for achieving desired goals.</li><li name="070c" id="070c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Consider the opportunity cost:</strong> Ask yourself what other opportunities may be missed if resources are invested in a losing proposition.</li><li name="c43e" id="c43e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Seek outside opinions:</strong> Consult with trusted individuals or a decision-making group to gain multiple perspectives and reduce the influence of personal bias.</li><li name="5a13" id="5a13" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Document the reasons behind decisions:</strong> Keeping a record of the reasons for investment in a particular project can help to avoid the sunk cost fallacy and make more objective decisions.</li><li name="ca35" id="ca35" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Practice mental accounting:</strong> Mentally separate sunk costs from future costs and potential benefits to avoid being influenced by previous investments.</li><li name="56b8" id="56b8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Set kill strategy:</strong> Determine a clear set of criteria for discontinuing a project and stick to it, rather than continuing based on sunk costs.</li></ol><p name="03f4" id="03f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li graf--trailing">Before you go — if you’ve got this far you’ve hopefully seen some value in this article.
