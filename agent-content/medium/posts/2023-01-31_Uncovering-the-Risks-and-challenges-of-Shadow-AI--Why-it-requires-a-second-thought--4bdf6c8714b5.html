It seems to be everywhere these days!</p><p name="650c" id="650c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you work at a company of any size, it’s likely that your employees are using AI to streamline their work processes, become more efficient, and keep up with evolving technologies. However, this trend also creates a new set of challenges, similar to those posed by shadow IT.</p><p name="63cc" id="63cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Shadow AI refers to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) models and technologies within a company that have not been approved or monitored by the central AI or IT teams. This occurs when employees use AI models or tools that they have obtained on their own or through their department, without consulting with central AI or IT teams.</p><p name="7a7c" id="7a7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While shadow AI can bring significant benefits to organizations, such as increased efficiency and improved decision-making, it can also pose significant risks. Organizations must consider the following key factors when dealing with shadow AI:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="05f4" id="05f4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Data privacy and security:</strong> Shadow AI models and tools may not be as secure as those that have been approved by central AI or IT teams. Employees using shadow AI may not be aware of the sensitive data they’re handling and may not follow proper protocols to keep it secure.</li><li name="66f0" id="66f0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Compliance with regulations:</strong> Shadow AI models and tools may not be compliant with regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This can lead to substantial fines and reputational damage if sensitive data is misused.</li><li name="418a" id="418a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Lack of transparency:</strong> Shadow AI models and tools may not be transparent in how they make decisions, making it difficult to understand why a particular outcome was reached. This lack of transparency can limit an organization’s ability to use shadow AI models for decision-making purposes and to ensure that their decisions are fair and unbiased.</li><li name="d764" id="d764" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Data quality: </strong>Shadow AI models and tools may be trained on low-quality or biased data, which can result in incorrect predictions and decisions. This can have serious consequences, particularly in industries like healthcare, finance, and criminal justice.</li><li name="4be1" id="4be1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Technical limitations:</strong> Shadow AI models and tools may have technical limitations that make them less effective or less scalable than approved AI models and tools. This can limit the benefits organizations can derive from shadow AI and can result in inefficiencies and increased costs.</li></ol><p name="5e5b" id="5e5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Organizations need to proactively address the challenges posed by shadow AI. This involves creating a centralized AI governance framework that covers the use of AI models and tools throughout the company, and providing employees with necessary training and tools to ensure that they use AI responsibly. By doing so, organizations can take advantage of the benefits of shadow AI while mitigating risks and ensuring that they use AI in a responsible and effective manner.</p><figure name="1687" id="1687" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*m77_L_cyko7VfH7JZR9MGg.png" data-width="607" data-height="619" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*m77_L_cyko7VfH7JZR9MGg.png"></figure><p name="f167" id="f167" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">Before you go — if you’ve got this far you’ve hopefully seen some value in this article.
