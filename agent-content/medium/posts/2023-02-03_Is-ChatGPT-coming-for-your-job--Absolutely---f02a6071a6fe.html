It seems to be everywhere!</p><p name="47ec" id="47ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So here is another opinion piece to add to the pile!</p><p name="9fa3" id="9fa3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">ChatGPT, or chat-based Generative Pretrained Transformer, is a language model developed by OpenAI that has been blowing up your news feeds. It’s been touted as a tool that could potentially replace human jobs in various industries, such as customer service and knowledge management. But what exactly is ChatGPT, and how far is it from taking over human jobs in the long term?</p><figure name="7d29" id="7d29" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Fc60Pi6PNkTz_utEmdYf3g.png" data-width="338" data-height="334" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Fc60Pi6PNkTz_utEmdYf3g.png"></figure><p name="dedd" id="dedd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Automating the past….</strong></p><p name="5b85" id="5b85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Historically, automation has disrupted a variety of industries including:</p><p name="e0ce" id="e0ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Automated assembly lines</strong> have replaced many manual jobs over the years such as welding and painting.</p><p name="a8e9" id="a8e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Retail has implemented self-checkout machines</strong>, replacing the need for cashiers, and automated inventory systems have significantly decreased the demand for stock clerks.</p><p name="05ba" id="05ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Transportation has partially embraced automation</strong>, with examples including self-driving trains on closed-loop tracks and aircrafts that have reduced the need for manual operations significantly.</p><p name="5f67" id="5f67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Customer service teams</strong> have implemented automated chatbots, voice-activated phone systems, and interactive routing systems, reducing the need for switchboard operators and cutting the number of customer service representatives.</p><p name="7e21" id="7e21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">5. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Banking has replaced tellers</strong> with ATMs, and online banking is reducing the number of people in brick and mortar buildings, accelerating the trend towards cashless societies.</p><p name="40ff" id="40ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In fact, it is difficult to think of an industry that has not been greatly improved by technology and automation. The key difference now is that ChatGPT offers high levels of abstraction, democratizing artificial intelligence and machine learning. With its ability to consume, process, and provide coherent answers based on large amounts of data in near real-time, it is hard to argue against its potential to become unstoppable.</p><p name="eb65" id="eb65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The trend towards automation is set to continue, potentially extending into the traditionally “untouchable” white-collar jobs.</p><p name="4647" id="4647" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Automating the future….</strong></p><p name="d97e" id="d97e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Consider a single source of truth for every law and precedent that has ever been established, which can be queried within seconds. Imagine the ability to create a contract that has been previously tested in court on a whim. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Talk about an ultimate lawyer — without the hefty hourly rate!</strong></p><p name="f3dd" id="f3dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What about a knowledge base that potentially comprises every single human ailment and its associated symptoms. Imagine if you could input a set of symptoms, combine them with the results of blood tests and other tests and then receive a comprehensive treatman plan. Furthermore, what if you could feed the results of every treatment into the system and iterate over them to determine the best course of action? An iterative approach to medical treatment for an entire demographic —<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> that’s a medical superpower!</strong></p><p name="16ab" id="16ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What about the limitations?</strong></p><p name="5867" id="5867" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Naturally, being a new technology, there are some limitations. Some of these may include:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="e247" id="e247" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Limited Context </strong>The model is currently trained on a large corpus of data, but it does not have the ability to rapidly ingest new information in real-time. Its knowledge cut-off is 2021, so it only includes information up to that point and may not reflect more recent events or developments. OpenAI regularly updates its models, so a newer version with a later knowledge cutoff may be released in the future.</li><li name="2c2a" id="2c2a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Limited Common Sense</strong>: ChatGPT has not been specifically trained on common sense knowledge, so it may not be able to answer questions that require an understanding of the world in the same way a human would.</li><li name="b0c7" id="b0c7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Bias:</strong> ChatGPT has been trained on a dataset that reflects the biases and societal inequalities that exist in the real world. As a result, it may generate responses that perpetuate these biases.</li><li name="bff2" id="bff2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Lack of Creativity:</strong> While ChatGPT can generate highly coherent text, it lacks the creativity and imagination of a human.</li><li name="76b1" id="76b1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Errors and Inaccuracies:</strong> Despite its large training corpus, ChatGPT may still make errors or provide inaccurate answers, particularly on complex or domain-specific questions.</li></ul><p name="e82d" id="e82d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Unlike humans….. who are unfallible! HA!</p><p name="cda0" id="cda0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Professions which will continue to need human inputs..</strong></p><p name="bc1b" id="bc1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With that in mind, there are certain professions or aspects of professions that will continue to be the domain of humans such (with incorporation of AI):</p><ol class="postList"><li name="d9b1" id="d9b1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Making human judgment calls that require decision making or considering complex scenarios — For example, for the time being, project management remains well-placed within the realm of real people.</li><li name="a478" id="a478" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">AI currently lacks the ability to make ethical or moral judgments. This means that while treatment plans in hospitals could be decided by an AI model, administering these in the best interests of patients with ethical considerations is a human trait. Similar with governments, public servants, education workers, and military personnel, who would need to make decisions with ethical considerations.</li><li name="6870" id="6870" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Where human creativity is required — While ChatGPT can generate highly coherent text, it lacks the creativity and imagination of the human mind. For example, AI can augment creative arts but it will never a substitute.</li><li name="ef2b" id="ef2b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Fact-checking and sense-checking output — Despite having a large dataset for training, ChatGPT can still produce inaccurate answers, particularly on complex and domain-specific content that is quite nuanced.</li><li name="b67f" id="b67f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Roles where empathy is needed — Imagine having a manager who is a robot?</li></ol><p name="613b" id="613b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What you should be doing today….</strong></p><p name="d06c" id="d06c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Using ChatGPT! The technology is here and it is very usable! Get familiar with it!</p><p name="8c03" id="8c03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Think about repetitive tasks that you need to complete on a day to day basis and see if ChatGPT can speed you up!</p><p name="8bc5" id="8bc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">ChatGPT should be used like any other tool (for example, a calculator) to make you more efficient.</p><p name="4b4e" id="4b4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some good example uses of ChatGPT:</p><p name="1d0c" id="1d0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Text generation:</strong> ChatGPT can be used to generate coherent and well-written text, such as articles, stories, and summaries.</p><p name="3005" id="3005" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Chatbots:</strong> ChatGPT can be used as the basis for a chatbot, allowing it to have conversations with users and provide information on a wide range of topics.</p><p name="d417" id="d417" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Content creation:</strong> ChatGPT can be used to create content for social media, such as tweets or posts, or to generate product descriptions or summaries.</p><p name="62fd" id="62fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Language translation:</strong> ChatGPT can be used to translate text from one language to another, providing quick and accurate translations for a variety of languages.</p><p name="95b4" id="95b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Question answering:</strong> ChatGPT can be used to answer questions and provide information on a wide range of topics, making it a useful tool for research and information gathering.</p><p name="d93d" id="d93d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Summarisation:</strong> ChatGPT can be used to summarize long articles or reports, making it easier to quickly understand their content.</p><p name="0aa4" id="0aa4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Explaining complex concepts in simple formats: </strong>Ask ChatGPT to explain quantum computing like you’re a 5 year old.</p><p name="9753" id="9753" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These are just a few examples, but the versatility and ability to generate text make ChatGPT a useful tool in many different applications. It’s important to keep in mind its limitations, however, and to use it appropriately in each scenario.</p><p name="b7cb" id="b7cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Most importantly — don’t ignore it! It’s only going to become more useful in your day to day tasks — and your competitors already are already benefiting!</strong></p></div></div></section>
