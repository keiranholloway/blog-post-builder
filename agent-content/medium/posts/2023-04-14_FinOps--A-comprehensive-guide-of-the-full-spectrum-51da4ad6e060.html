While cost governance and cloud optimization is not a new concept, the evolution of FinOps has captured the attention of many.</p><p name="0613" id="0613" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As someone who has spent a significant amount of time running cost-focused programs for customers, my thoughts on FinOps are continuing to evolve.</p><p name="b559" id="b559" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One observation is that FinOps programs often aims to be ‘all-inclusive’. As such, striving to consider the full total cost of ownership (TCO) for cloud environments. Arguably, this is the best and most comprehensive way to approach cost management within the cloud. This approach is also likely to be labour-intensive and costly to execute. Unless you are spending more than $10k/month on cloud or with the intention to increase, it is also almost certainly overkill.</p><p name="e9a7" id="e9a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this post, I delve into the diverse spectrum of cloud management concepts and examine the development of FinOps. As with most things in the cloud, there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution for FinOps. My goal is to demystify various approaches used. This should also offer guidance to help you determine the best strategy for your organization.</p><h4 name="a9cf" id="a9cf" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Introducing the FinOps Spectrum</h4><figure name="9d0a" id="9d0a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*XsDgfm5l95bQGtPujPnQDw.png" data-width="1522" data-height="223" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XsDgfm5l95bQGtPujPnQDw.png"></figure><h4 name="c889" id="c889" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Tooling and visibility</h4><p name="c899" id="c899" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is it?</strong></p><p name="f386" id="f386" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Start by gaining visibility into your cloud costs on your respective hyperscaler. For AWS, there are native tools like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/" data-href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cost Explorer</a>. This tool will give you some insight around existing spend and potential cost optimizations. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/" data-href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trusted Advisor </a>can give some high-level ideas around where services can be optimized (or removed, if unused).</p><p name="0d86" id="0d86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are also other third party tools such as <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/aria.html" data-href="https://www.vmware.com/products/aria.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VMWare’s Aria</a> (previously Cloud Health) and <a href="https://cloudcheckr.com/" data-href="https://cloudcheckr.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CloudCheckr </a>which can provide a consolidated view around spend.</p><p name="b1b7" id="b1b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Effectiveness: Low</strong></p><p name="b34f" id="b34f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At this end of the spectrum the focus is largely around providing visibility and not necessarily policing spend. There are cost optimization changes which can be made. However, this needs to be measured against the cost of taking your engineers away from other tasks which may be more important to the business (such as releasing features and generating revenue!).</p><p name="52ec" id="52ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Optimizing for spend and cleaning up resources is good from an operational hygiene point of view. Make sure you factor in the time required to get context around resource usage. This will need to come from engineers and application builders — often the most contended resource in your organisation.</p><p name="4292" id="4292" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I find that visibility gives insight and drives awareness around cost. This doesn’t immediately result in cost reduction in your environment. However, it does establish good operational practices with cost appreciation.</p><p name="b9cc" id="b9cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Effort: Low</strong></p><p name="ac43" id="ac43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Any tooling deployed should be able to at least give you a starting point as to where you should look.</p><p name="c4ac" id="c4ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This activity is more about driving visibility and understanding of cloud spend. There are likely some ‘quick-wins’ identified through these tools. Executing against this should be prioritised against other revenue-generating activities that the teams may be working on.</p><p name="f29e" id="f29e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cost Spend Profile: $ ($100s/month+ )</strong></p><p name="36c8" id="36c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The idea being that cloud spend should be top of mind without an active FinOps function. This mean, formalised FinOps team, processes or governance attached. Spend within the cloud will remain the responsibility of the teams operating there.</p><p name="aff4" id="aff4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What should you do now:</strong></p><ul class="postList"><li name="2123" id="2123" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Consider how much wastage is within your cloud environment is acceptable. What does a 25–35% saving mean to your business? For example, if you’re spending $2500/month on AWS there isn’t significant value in doing ‘FinOps’</li><li name="fde5" id="fde5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Decide if adding more work to your engineering team / application owners is worth the available cost-savings.</li><li name="8bc8" id="8bc8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Educate engineers using the cloud about how they can view and understand cloud spend. This will allow empowerment and make cost conscious decisions around architecture practices.</li><li name="ac7f" id="ac7f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Think about how you can automatically deliver cost reports and insight to consumers. This will help keep cost at the top of mind.</li></ul><h4 name="29c1" id="29c1" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Cost Showback</h4><p name="58a8" id="58a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is it?</strong></p><p name="a5a4" id="a5a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Allocating cost to the teams and the cost centres responsible for the spend is a good cost management practice. Amazon Cost usage reports and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/" data-href="https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AWS Organization</a> can help you with resource tagging. Resource tags allow spend to be attributed to teams to allow to understand their cloud spend.</p><p name="b734" id="b734" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tools like <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/aria.html" data-href="https://www.vmware.com/products/aria.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VMWare Aria</a> (Cloud Health) can help with building up cost perspectives on how much each team is spending within the Cloud. This is determined using resource tags so it imperative to have an effective tagging strategy.</p><p name="b022" id="b022" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Effectiveness: Low</strong></p><p name="5fbe" id="5fbe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To hold teams and individuals accountable for spend within the cloud you need to be able to track who is creating which resource. This is the cornerstone of any FinOps/Cost Management workstream at scale.</p><p name="725d" id="725d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This item is considered low effectiveness. Whilst this will tell you who created the spend — this will not necessarily optimize cloud cost. This activity is to facilitate teams and individuals to understand their cloud spend. If it cannot be understood, then it cannot be managed.</p><p name="ecf2" id="ecf2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Effort: Low/Medium</strong></p><p name="b558" id="b558" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tagging resources in principle is a easy thing to do. Yet, doing this with cloud resources already running can be time consuming. Part of this activity is tracking down who created the resource and then tagging correctly. Sometimes, this requires redeploying to make it stick. This is one of these topics which is important to get nailed sooner rather than later. The longer you leave it — the harder it is to address. This is quintessential technical debt and will grow overtime if left unchecked.</p><p name="75f6" id="75f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cloud Spend: $ ($100s/month+)</strong></p><p name="fc58" id="fc58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Providing Cost Showback/attribution is important to get right. Irrespective of your footprint size within the cloud getting this right will make your life easier in the long run.</p><p name="2856" id="2856" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What should you do now:</strong></p><ul class="postList"><li name="3743" id="3743" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Establish a tagging strategy for cost attribution</li><li name="72b5" id="72b5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Build out reports to report on who is spending what — make sure that these are periodically reviewed.</li><li name="bce8" id="bce8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Educate engineers and teams around how they can be cost conscious.

The effectiveness of this approach generally yields good return on investment.</p><p name="c749" id="c749" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Effort: Low/Medium</strong></p><p name="a678" id="a678" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You will need to distract developers and application owners away from their day jobs to implement changes. The good thing, it is relatively low effort as there shouldn’t be any need to rearchitect or change the way in which the cloud is used. For the most part, this should be looking at how resources have been deployed and considering how they are being used now. If they are no longer required, then they can be turned off and even destroyed.</p><p name="638d" id="638d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The effort may increase where there are abandoned resources and finding the owner is tricky!

Consideration needs to be given against how much wastage there is within a cloud environment to get an idea around how much saving is there. For example, it is not uncommon to find 25–35% wastage within any cloud environment. If your bill is $5000/month and you can generate more revenue through having your engineers working on releasing new feature, then there RIO may not be there to spend significant amounts of time.</p><p name="02a0" id="02a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What you should think about:</strong></p><ul class="postList"><li name="db78" id="db78" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Infrastructure optimization is one of the easier ways to quickly save money and is an early-stage activity within FinOps.</li><li name="b94c" id="b94c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Every cloud environment that I’ve come across has some amount of wastage. This is typically at least in the region of 25–35% if your teams are not considering cost during design, implementation and on-going operations.</li><li name="aa9a" id="aa9a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Tooling will give insight, but context from your engineering teams and application owners is needed to progress.</li><li name="cba7" id="cba7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Remember, cloud engineers will need to do work to make savings.

This reframes how the stakeholders view consumption within the cloud. Cloud architecture and cost optimization are one and the same. During the design process cloud cost can be considered as a non-functional requirement. This means that cost is discussed as part of architectural practices and solutions are devised understanding the on-going financial implications.</p><p name="cec1" id="cec1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Effort: Medium/High</strong></p><p name="8a33" id="8a33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whilst this will deliver highly optimized cloud environments there is an overhead.

This is a quick way into the cloud, but it is also generally more expensive then running this within a legacy hosting environment. Persistent running costs add up quickly.</p><p name="763b" id="763b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Taking advantage of cloud native primitives will almost certainly save you money, however, they require re-architecture which is an expensive exercise.</p><p name="c282" id="c282" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Effectiveness: High</strong></p><p name="9143" id="9143" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Taking legacy applications running in static compute instances and recrafting these to take advantage of cloud native primitives is a good cost optimization approach.

This is very much an activity that can be characterized as ‘spend money to save money’. In this case though — the money is engineering time and effort. This needs to be considered against other areas where you engineers could be investing time.</p><p name="24b9" id="24b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cloud Spend Profile: $$$ ($10,000s/month+)</strong></p><p name="0af8" id="0af8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not for the faint-hearted.

According to some FinOps practitioners this means that it can be used to ensure that all services are operated in a consistent and governed way. This can result in it also extending across other disciplines including things like sustainability, security, reliability, performance, and architectural practices.</p><p name="55c1" id="55c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Effectiveness: High</strong></p><p name="6dab" id="6dab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is highly effective but as it requires inputs from all other components it also requires a level of operational maturity to perform in a meaningful way.</p><p name="f0d4" id="f0d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Effort: High</strong></p><p name="f463" id="f463" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This takes a level of maturity to implement and should be expected to be an extended project within its own right.</p><p name="de54" id="de54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cloud Spend: $$$ — $$$$ (Thousands to Millions/month)</strong></p><p name="65d4" id="65d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What you should think about:</strong></p><ul class="postList"><li name="022e" id="022e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Transition to utilizing a full FinOps approach will encourage operational maturity and ensure that you are getting the best cost optimization within the cloud.</li><li name="3822" id="3822" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">This is intended to transcend across the cloud practices but also look at the entire operating model (spanning people, process and technology).</li><li name="2751" id="2751" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">FinOps in its entirety is incredibly broad.

(Think: crawl, walk, run).</li><li name="13e5" id="13e5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Cloud Spend — </strong>Review your bills and understand both your bill today, and your anticipated trajectory. If your bill is within the hundreds and will likely end up in the thousands per month then you likely only want to adopt some of the early phases. Alternatively, if that trajectory is into the millions — act quickly. Getting cost governance and control in place early will save you significantly.</li><li name="6731" id="6731" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Human Resourcing — </strong>Whilst tooling will get you part of the way, you need to focus on skills and knowledge around two areas. Firstly, around the cloud hyperscaler. You need access to knowledgeable cloud engineers and architects to be effective. Secondly, you will need access and time for the application owners and operators in the cloud to give you context around their business uses of the cloud.</li></ul><figure name="f533" id="f533" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--li"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*8caGKjup3uenCovqPFH_bQ.png" data-width="531" data-height="227" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8caGKjup3uenCovqPFH_bQ.png"></figure><p name="6849" id="6849" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In conclusion, I have also written a number of other articles related to this topic which can be found at:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="d1d0" id="d1d0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><a href="https://medium.com/@KeiranHolloway/avoiding-common-pitfalls-when-running-a-cloud-cost-optimisation-program-c3da6d13f199" data-href="https://medium.com/@KeiranHolloway/avoiding-common-pitfalls-when-running-a-cloud-cost-optimisation-program-c3da6d13f199" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" target="_blank">Avoiding Common pitfalls when running a Cloud Cost Optimization program</a></li><li name="d9b1" id="d9b1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><a href="https://medium.com/@KeiranHolloway/how-to-run-a-successful-aws-cost-optimization-program-6c057b08b15a" data-href="https://medium.com/@KeiranHolloway/how-to-run-a-successful-aws-cost-optimization-program-6c057b08b15a" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" target="_blank">How to run a successful AWS Cost-Optimization Program</a></li><li name="69f3" id="69f3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/11031/460626" data-href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/11031/460626" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Achieving cost optimization through containers and serverless technologies</a></li><li name="1fd1" id="1fd1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><a href="https://www.rackspace.com/en-gb/blog/focusing-just-cost-optimization-youve-already-wasted-money" data-href="https://www.rackspace.com/en-gb/blog/focusing-just-cost-optimization-youve-already-wasted-money" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Focusing on cost optimization?
