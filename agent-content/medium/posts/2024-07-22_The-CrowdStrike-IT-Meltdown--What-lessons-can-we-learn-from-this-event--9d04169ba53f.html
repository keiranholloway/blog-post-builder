In light of last week’s events, however, CrowdStrike might be feeling the full implications of that statement after transforming from a publicly listed company known primarily in tech circles to a household name overnight — and not for the most positive reasons. Due to a software update that was automatically deployed to their 24,000-strong, enterprise-heavy user base, CrowdStrike managed to disrupt point of sale systems, air travel, and banking operations at lightning speed.</p><figure name="10d9" id="10d9" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*3nH3Y8ZNKzPLSeWN" data-width="1792" data-height="1024" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*3nH3Y8ZNKzPLSeWN"></figure><p name="df5c" id="df5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In retrospect, CrowdStrike’s response to this event was mostly commendable. They took ownership of the issue and quickly embarked on a roadshow of apologies and remediation support. It was certainly a “bad day” for CrowdStrike. Companies generally get a single free pass on an event of this magnitude. However, the need to be careful with how they move forward. This incident offers a unique opportunity for the broader technical and IT security industry to learn from.</p><p name="3e8a" id="3e8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One observation from this event is that, being a security company, they trade in<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> credibility and trust</strong>. One of the elements I found a little bit off was their attempt to downplay the level of recovery effort involved. The CEO was quoted as saying, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The issue has been identified, isolated, and a fix has been deployed.</em>”</strong></p><p name="ba00" id="ba00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">…</p><p name="237a" id="237a" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Many of the customers are rebooting the system and it’s coming up and it’ll be operational,” he said, but added: “It could be some time for some systems that won’t automatically recover.”</em></strong></p><p name="f0db" id="f0db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For engineers who understood the implications of the event, it was clear early on that manual intervention would be required. This manual intervention would require physical hands on keyboards, and any automated fix could not be automatically deployed. This was never going to be a quick process.</p><p name="e056" id="e056" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whilst it is appreciated that CrowdStrike is a publicly listed company, using carefully crafted, word-smithed responses with broad-based distribution only sounds disingenuous to those ‘in the know.’</p><p name="796d" id="796d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a time to eat humble pie, accept that you’re a company made up with humans who can get it wrong. Recovery gracerfully and avoid getting on the defensive or redirecting blame to other parties (eg, Microsoft).</p><h3 name="934d" id="934d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Key Lessons from the CrowdStrike Incident</h3><p name="5bab" id="5bab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Measured Response is Crucial</strong>: The impulse to react swiftly can be tempting, but decisions driven by emotion or recent events often lead to short-sighted solutions. It’s essential to approach crisis management with a well-considered strategy rather than knee-jerk reactions.</p><p name="177b" id="177b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Going all Elon Musk — probably isn’t the most considered response:</p><figure name="37aa" id="37aa" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Ao4sAPTLgVsg3qeiTwY99w.png" data-width="662" data-height="269" alt="…perhaps going all Elon is not the best approach." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ao4sAPTLgVsg3qeiTwY99w.png"></figure><p name="f4eb" id="f4eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Robust Communication Systems</strong>: Effective out-of-band communication is vital during significant disruptions. The failure to maintain robust communication channels can severely hinder incident response and resolution efforts. This event likely took out key infrastructure — a back for incident response is something every organisation should implement.</p><p name="593f" id="593f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Be Wary of Opportunistic Vendors</strong>: In the aftermath of such incidents, numerous vendors may seize the opportunity to market their solutions as the ideal alternative. If considering a switch, ask critical questions about how their products would prevent similar failures.</p><p name="e564" id="e564" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Avoid Overcomplicating the Solution</strong>: There was some talk around introducing redundant endpoint protection. This would only exacerbate issues rather than resolve them. Adding complexity can double the risk and increase the workload for operational and security teams.</p><p name="1e79" id="1e79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Rebuilding Trust through Transparency</strong>: CrowdStrike is a company which has built itself upon taking adversity and making it a viable business. They must now focus on rebuilding trust with consumers. Security vendors operate by selling trust, and while CrowdStrike’s initial response was commendable, they need to be transparent about how they ended up in this situation. This involves answering tough questions and providing transparency into what went wrong. Accepting and addressing operational gaps can turn this into a learning exercise for the entire industry.</p><p name="97ce" id="97ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Incremental Updates Are Best</strong>: The practice of rolling out all changes simultaneously is outdated. Embracing traditional deployment methods or modern CI/CD strategies, such as canary deployments, can mitigate the risk of widespread disruptions. CrowdStike are not alone here, but having agents which automatically update themselves on constumer end-points will always exhibit this behaviour. System Administrators need more control and this is somewhat uniform across lots of SaaS providers which deploy agents for greater insight.</p><p name="e384" id="e384" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Increased Accountability for Security Vendors</strong>: Security companies must be held to higher standards, with greater visibility and offer more control over our production systems. The approach to categorizing updates — much like operating system vendors do — can help prioritize critical fixes and manage deployment windows. Security vendors must also make sure that they are following best-practices against the operating systems which they’re operating on this. This includes following operating system conventions (eg, installing programs into sensible locations) and gracefully handling error conditions. There was a great <a href="https://x.com/Perpetualmaniac/status/1814376668095754753" data-href="https://x.com/Perpetualmaniac/status/1814376668095754753" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">commentary on X around how the agent failed to handle this error condition satisfactorily</a>.</p><p name="79c1" id="79c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Avoiding End-of-Week Updates</strong>: While not always feasible in a security context, avoiding updates on Fridays or near weekends can prevent unnecessary risks. System owners and operators should have the autonomy to determine their security posture based on their specific threat landscape, rather than having updates forced upon them.</p><p name="e236" id="e236" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Prioritize Thorough Testing</strong>: Rigorous testing before deployment is essential. Software should adhere to the conventions of the host operating system and support resilient, immutable deployments to ensure reliability and security.</p><p name="cfaa" id="cfaa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The CrowdStrike IT meltdown was a significant disruption, but it also serves as a valuable case study. The broader technical and IT security industries can learn much from how CrowdStrike handled the crisis. By understanding and applying these lessons, we can improve our systems, enhance our crisis response strategies, and ultimately build a more resilient digital future.</p></div></div></section><section name="f647" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="6a30" id="6a30" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing">Before you go — if you’ve got this far you’ve hopefully seen some value in this article.
