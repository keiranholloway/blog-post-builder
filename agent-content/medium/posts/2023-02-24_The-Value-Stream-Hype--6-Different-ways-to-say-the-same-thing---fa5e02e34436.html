It’s like they’re speaking a whole different language sometimes! And right now, the phrase on everyone’s lips is “Value-Stream.” But hey, it’s all good — whether you’re talking about value-stream or something else entirely, as long as we’re all on the same page, we can keep on moving forward. So let’s take a breather, enjoy the weekend, and come back next week ready to tackle whatever buzzwords come our way</p><p name="676b" id="676b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Value-Streams — from various perspectives:</strong></p><ol class="postList"><li name="441c" id="441c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Digital Transformation —</strong> All businesses are currently undergoing a “Digital Transformation.” What is this, you might ask? It involves looking at the people, processes, and technology (fondly referred to as PPT henceforth) used within a business, and embracing new technology while phasing out the old. It’s like replacing your old rotary phone with a fully-loaded smartphone, all while making your business more efficient in the process.</li><li name="a370" id="a370" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Continuous improvement — </strong>It involves making small, incremental changes to improve the way things are done. We’re talking about taking a close look at the PPT squad and finding ways to make them even better, using the latest and greatest in cloud technologies. So let’s crank up the music, throw some confetti, and get ready to make some real improvements around here!</li><li name="a340" id="a340" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">FinOps</strong> — The ultimate way to manage your cloud costs and financial performance in a chill and relaxed way. The term “FinOps” stands for “financial operations,” and it’s all about making sure that your cloud spending aligns with your business objectives while also optimizing costs. FinOps involves three key elements: people, processes, and technology (yep, the good ol’ PPT). So if you’re looking to keep things running smoothly and avoid any financial surprises, FinOps is the way to go!</li><li name="b1f2" id="b1f2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Flow Optimization — </strong>Picture this: a factory floor with machines whirring and conveyor belts moving products from one end to the other. Now, take that same concept and apply it to DevOps practices, and you’ve got “Flow.” It’s all about managing the supply chain and optimizing the flow of activities from start to finish. And you guessed it — the PPT squad is always part of the conversation. By focusing on a smooth and continuous flow of work, we can improve efficiency and quality, and ensure that our products and services get to customers faster. So let’s keep the flow going, folks!</li><li name="f999" id="f999" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Silo Busting —</strong>Let’s bust some silos, baby! Silo busting is all about breaking down the walls between different teams, departments, or functions within an organization. You know, those pesky “silos” that operate independently and make it hard for different teams to work together. But silo busting isn’t just about people — it’s also about taking a closer look at communication processes and tools, to make sure everyone is on the same page. By breaking down those silos and promoting cross-functional collaboration, we can achieve better results and reach our goals more efficiently. So let’s grab our sledgehammers and get to work!</li><li name="f9b1" id="f9b1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Lean Principals</strong> — This concept was coined in a book by the same name, and it’s all about applying some of the other concepts we’ve been talking about — like Flow Optimization, Mapping Value, and Continuous Improvement — specifically to start-up businesses. The Lean Startup is all about finding ways to create value for your customers while minimizing waste, by testing and iterating on your ideas as quickly as possible.</li></ol><p name="5e5b" id="5e5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Any others ways in which you’ve heard the same thing?</p><p name="5eb7" id="5eb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Before you go — if you’ve got this far you’ve hopefully seen some value in this article. I write and publish this content free of charge. The cost for reading it though?
