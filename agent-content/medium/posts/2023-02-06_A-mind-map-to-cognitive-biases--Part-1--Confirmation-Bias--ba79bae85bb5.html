Cognitive biases are inherent flaws in the thought process and decision-making processes of our brains. The Human mind is trained to recognize patterns and often take shortcuts to reach conclusions. In our professional lives, we often encounter problems that are similar to situations we have encountered before. Our brains rapidly assess the situation and make a decision based on past experiences in milliseconds using sophisticated heuristics. Although this optimizes performance, it can lead to incorrect conclusions when our brains assess a situation incorrectly.</p><p name="73d3" id="73d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cognitive Bases can result in a flawed decision or an ineffective strategy.</strong></p><p name="f297" id="f297" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are many types of cognitive biases that we can encounter. In the next few posts, I will examine each of these and cover:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="3920" id="3920" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">What is the cognitive bias?</li><li name="ea66" id="ea66" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How it affects good decision making, particularly in a technical setting</li><li name="f07d" id="f07d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">An example of the cognitive bias</li><li name="2d81" id="2d81" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Techniques to avoid it in the future.</li></ol><p name="4ebc" id="4ebc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">First up: Confirmation basis</strong></p><p name="4c23" id="4c23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Confirmation bias is a cognitive bias where individuals seek, interpret, or remember information in a manner that confirms their pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses. People often give more importance to information that aligns with their views, and ignore or undervalue information that contradicts them. This can lead to overconfidence in their beliefs and making decisions based on partial or biased information. Confirmation bias can also contribute to the spread of false information and the strengthening of stereotypes and prejudices.</p><p name="8d53" id="8d53" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How this affect decision making…</strong></p><p name="266e" id="266e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Humans often tend to seek information that confirms their existing beliefs. For example, if someone doesn’t believe in vaccinations for a contagious disease, they may search the internet for reasons why vaccination is bad. The information they find reinforces their belief, but it can also lead to poor decision-making as they are not taking into account other information that may challenge their perspective. When searching for specific information, it’s easy to find information that supports one’s views, leading to a reinforcement of confirmation bias.</p><p name="121f" id="121f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Example of this within a technical setting…</strong></p><p name="c1c0" id="c1c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A website administrator was trying to fix a server issue causing the site to frequently go offline. They believed the issue was with their hosting provider’s network, as that had been the cause of previous issues. The administrator focused their efforts on contacting the hosting provider, demanding resolution of the network issue. There was a lot of effort spent troubleshooting network devices and rebooting firewalls to solve the issue. Searching the Internet for “reasons a website goes down” reinforced their belief, as the most common cause listed was the hosting provider.</p><p name="d4e1" id="d4e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, after multiple calls and exchanges and time waster, the administrator logged into the web server and found an entry in the log file indicating that “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">max connections</em>” were being reached. The actual cause of the issue was that the single machine was being overwhelmed, not the upstream network connectivity.</p><p name="645b" id="645b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this scenario, the administrator’s confirmation bias led to a narrow focus on the hosting provider and ignored other potential causes, potentially delaying the resolution of the problem and causing frustration for both the administrator and the hosting provider. By only focusing on the hosting provider, the administrator may have missed the opportunity to identify and resolve the root cause of the problem, potentially leading to a missed opportunity for a simpler solution.</p><p name="6aca" id="6aca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Techniques for avoiding confirmation bias…</strong></p><p name="7fc7" id="7fc7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are several methods to counteract confirmation bias:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="4c1c" id="4c1c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Acknowledge and address the bias:</strong> Recognize when you’re making assumptions and not fully verifying the information. Challenge your beliefs to improve decision-making.</li><li name="5955" id="5955" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Disprove the hypothesis:</strong> If your usual solution doesn’t work, try to disprove your hypothesis. For example, if you suspect that the issue is network-related, you can monitor the upstream network devices for availability to see if it’s the case.</li><li name="beda" id="beda" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Consider alternative explanations: </strong>When faced with a decision, try to view it from another angle and validate your logic to avoid overlooking important information.</li><li name="409b" id="409b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Stay open to new information:</strong> Be willing to adjust your views when new data comes along and don’t dismiss information that doesn’t support your original hypothesis.</li><li name="d762" id="d762" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Collaborate with others:</strong> Work with people who have different viewpoints and approaches to problem-solving to broaden your understanding and reduce the impact of confirmation bias.</li><li name="c31a" id="c31a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Take a break:</strong> If you find yourself becoming too invested in a specific outcome, step back and come back later with a fresh perspective.</li></ol><p name="4d00" id="4d00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li graf--trailing">Before you go — if you’ve got this far you’ve hopefully seen some value in this article.
