It is the tendency to remember and focus on the most recent information, rather than looking at the overall pattern of information.</p><p name="5841" id="5841" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, in sports, a team that has recently won a few games may be overvalued, even though their past performance may not be as good. Or in an interview process, a candidate who performs well in the final interview may be more likely to be hired, even if their previous interviews were not as strong.</p><p name="2e41" id="2e41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How this affect decision making…</strong></p><p name="9d40" id="9d40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Recency bias can affect decision making in many areas of life, including finance, politics, and personal relationships. It can lead to snap judgments and impulsive decisions, which may not be based on a full understanding of the situation.</p><p name="b29b" id="b29b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Example of this within a technical setting…</strong></p><p name="965e" id="965e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">An example of recency bias in a technology setting is when a computer user notices that their computer is getting slower and less reliable over time. This can cause the user to focus only on recent experiences and forget the overall history of the computer’s performance.</p><p name="5dd6" id="5dd6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For instance, the user may have installed new software or hardware recently, which has caused the computer to slow down. However, they may not be considering that the computer is several years old and has been used extensively during that time, which may also be contributing to its reduced performance.</p><p name="5ee2" id="5ee2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a result, the user may make the decision to upgrade or replace the computer, without considering other factors such as the age of the computer, the amount of RAM, or the available storage space. This decision may not be the best one, as the user may be able to improve the performance of the computer by performing maintenance tasks, such as deleting unnecessary files, running disk clean-up, or optimizing the system settings</p><p name="f275" id="f275" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Techniques for avoiding sun cost fallacy…</strong></p><p name="dfe4" id="dfe4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To avoid recency bias, it is important to take a step back and consider the entire history of a situation or problem, rather than focusing only on recent experiences. Here are some tips to help avoid recency bias:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="837c" id="837c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Gather all relevant data:</strong> Make sure you have all the relevant information about a situation or problem, including its history and any factors that may be contributing to the current situation.</li><li name="b4c7" id="b4c7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Take time to reflect:</strong> Before making a decision, take some time to reflect on the situation and consider all the relevant information you have gathered.</li><li name="35fc" id="35fc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Consider alternative explanations: </strong>Be open to alternative explanations for a situation or problem, and consider all possible causes, not just the most recent ones.</li><li name="292d" id="292d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Avoid snap judgments:</strong> Try not to make snap judgments based on recent experiences alone. Instead, take a more measured approach, considering all available information before making a decision.</li><li name="7478" id="7478" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Seek input from others: </strong>Get input from others who have different perspectives and experiences. This can help to provide a more balanced view of the situation.</li></ol><p name="45c1" id="45c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">By being aware of recency bias and taking these steps to avoid it, you can make better decisions that are based on a full understanding of the situation.</p><p name="a551" id="a551" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Before you go — if you’ve got this far you’ve hopefully seen some value in this article.
