It offers businesses an opportunity to increase agility and respond more quickly to the ever-changing demands of the market. However, despite the potential benefits of the cloud, many companies still face significant hurdles when trying to adopt it. One of the most significant obstacles is analysis paralysis, which can lead to slow decision-making and hinder cloud adoption.</p><p name="2579" id="2579" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Coud technology can help businesses solve complex challenges. By removing heavy-lifting activities such as purchasing and provisioning hardware and software, installing upgrades and patches, provisioning network connectivity, and configuring and maintaining backups, businesses can focus their time and energy on value-generating activities that grow their business. The cloud enables companies to do things more quickly and efficiently than ever before. In some cases, organisations have gone from an idea to a working proof of concept within hours.</p><p name="64fc" id="64fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Despite the benefits of cloud adoption, many companies still struggle with analysis paralysis, leading to slow decision-making and, ultimately, hindering cloud adoption. We’ve observed large enterprises, even those that have adopted a cloud-first strategy, get bogged down in various rounds of analysis, causing delays and ultimately adding no value to their customers.</p><p name="3b6c" id="3b6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To help companies embrace cloud adoption and cloud agility, we recommend the following five best practices:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="6f15" id="6f15" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Build out a cloud management office.</strong> A cloud management office is a cross-functional team responsible for transitioning to cloud technologies. It’s essential to recognise that moving to the cloud requires a cultural shift in addition to process adaptation.</li><li name="98d4" id="98d4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Be prepared to make some mistakes along the way.</strong> Focus on delivering the minimum viable product (MVP) to avoid analysis paralysis. The first iteration of an idea doesn’t need to be perfect; through the process of getting something out the door, you’ll learn a lot.</li><li name="b115" id="b115" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Don’t take silly risks.</strong> While it’s important to recognise that you will make some mistakes, you must still be mindful of the level of risk associated with each decision. If you’re at a decision point which is effectively betting the company, then of course, it’s worthwhile to speak to a wide range of experts both internally and externally before making a decision.</li><li name="5ad5" id="5ad5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Make incremental, reversible changes.</strong> Try something new and untested, but make sure it’s reversible. This approach is particularly useful when testing new ideas or features on a website or app.</li><li name="8da2" id="8da2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Lean in and speak with specialists in each area.</strong> Speaking with external parties can accelerate many of your technology decisions. Leaning into their advice is likely going to help you avoid common pitfalls along your cloud adoption journey.</li></ol><p name="f207" id="f207" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">In conclusion, don’t delay. Your good idea is worth nothing without execution. The cloud offers incredible speed and agility to businesses, and now is the time to embrace it.</p><p name="a942" id="a942" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Before you go — if you’ve got this far you’ve hopefully seen some value in this article.
