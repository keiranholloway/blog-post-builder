One of the most interesting architectural patterns is event-driven architecture (EDA) practices, which serve as an effective way to disaggregate the traditional monolithic application, as well as provide an extensible data plane for microservices to consume inputs. This blog post is intended to provide an introduction to EDA, as well as a high-level example of how it could be implemented.</p><p name="dbfa" id="dbfa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Event-driven architecture is a software design approach that allows different components of a system to communicate with each other by producing and consuming events. An event is a significant occurrence, such as a user’s action, a change in the system’s state, or an external system’s notification. When an event occurs, the appropriate component(s) of the system will respond by processing the event and taking appropriate action.</p><p name="eee3" id="eee3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Event Driven Architecture Components…</strong></p><p name="84c4" id="84c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the highest level, there are effectively 4 components:</p><p name="1e13" id="1e13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Events: </strong>These are the signals that indicate that something has happened in the system. Events can be generated by users, applications, or other systems.</p><p name="8c33" id="8c33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Event Message Bus:</strong> An event message bus, also known as an event bus or event streaming platform, is a messaging infrastructure that enables event-driven communication between different components of a distributed system. Events are typically published to an event message bus.</p><p name="c127" id="c127" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Event producers:</strong> These are the components that generate events. They can be any application, system, or device that can generate an event which adds the event to the messaging bus.</p><p name="0c5a" id="0c5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Event consumers: </strong>These are the components that consume events. They can be any application, system, or device that needs to react to an event. These will read messages off the Event messaging bus.</p><p name="e0a5" id="e0a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Common Event Driven Architecture Patterns…</strong></p><p name="8ca0" id="8ca0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are a range of common event driven architecture patterns including:</p><p name="9d96" id="9d96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Event notification pattern:</strong> This pattern is used when one component needs to inform other components that a particular event has occurred. The component producing the event publishes it to an event broker, and the interested subscribers can consume the event to take necessary action.</p><p name="c0ca" id="c0ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Event-driven messaging pattern:</strong> This pattern involves passing messages between different components of the system to trigger a response. The message contains information about the event that has occurred, and the recipient processes it accordingly.</p><p name="42c7" id="42c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern:</strong> This pattern separates the read and write operations of the system into separate components, known as commands and queries. Commands are responsible for updating the system state and publishing events, while queries are responsible for retrieving the system’s state.</p><p name="0464" id="0464" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4.<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> Event sourcing pattern: </strong>This pattern involves storing the entire history of events that have occurred in the system, rather than just the current state. This approach allows the system to be reconstructed at any point in time, which can be useful for debugging, auditing, and compliance purposes.</p><p name="fd5d" id="fd5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">5. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Saga pattern:</strong> This pattern is used to manage long-running transactions that involve multiple components. It uses a set of coordinated compensating actions to ensure that the transaction can be rolled back if any component fails.</p><p name="1d30" id="1d30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Benefits of using Event Driven Architecture…</strong></p><p name="95d9" id="95d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are several reasons why you might want to use an event-driven architecture (EDA) for your software design:</p><p name="c2c1" id="c2c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Scalability:</strong> EDA can help you build highly scalable systems that can handle a large volume of events and users. By allowing different components to operate independently and asynchronously, you can distribute the load across multiple servers or nodes.</p><p name="4b52" id="4b52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Flexibility:</strong> EDA allows you to add or remove components from the system without affecting the other components. This can make it easier to modify and evolve the system over time.</p><p name="2650" id="2650" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Decoupling:</strong> EDA can help you decouple different components of the system, so that they don’t have to know about each other’s implementation details. This can make the system more modular and easier to maintain.</p><p name="1271" id="1271" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Real-time processing:</strong> EDA allows you to process events in real-time, which can be useful in applications where quick responses are required.</p><p name="0baf" id="0baf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">5. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Event-driven workflows:</strong> EDA can help you design workflows that are triggered by events, such as processing a payment or sending a notification. This can help you automate business processes and improve efficiency.</p><p name="21f7" id="21f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Event Driven Architect Example…</strong></p><p name="84bf" id="84bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this example, we are focused on Bank or similar type of financial organisation. The following depicts the flow of events using event driven architecture. The flow is from left to right.</p><figure name="bd79" id="bd79" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*q_D2LzcmOL5WzU3jiVfIEA.png" data-width="1323" data-height="410" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*q_D2LzcmOL5WzU3jiVfIEA.png"></figure><p name="bcb9" id="bcb9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">On the left hand side (Event Producers) there is a system of record (SoR) which is generating transactions and publishing events to the Event Message Bus. The types of messages which would be published could cover a number of different scenarios including. For example:</p><p name="f398" id="f398" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. Money successfully deposited <br>2. Successful withdrawal from an account <br>3. Transaction challenge (for example, validating that this is a real account).</p><p name="a4ee" id="a4ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The event will be generated as result of a specific acation. The system of record will then publish this transaction activity to the event message bus with sufficient metadata around the transaction (for example, success or failure).</p><p name="a6ce" id="a6ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Microservices can then consume these messages off the queue in a completely decoupled way. All the business logic is self-contained within each microservice which means that these can be added, removed or changed independently of other components within the application. This approach allows for end-to-end transaction, in a decoupled way.</p><p name="3536" id="3536" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Some examples…</strong></p><p name="4e13" id="4e13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Transaction One:</strong> A successful withdrawal of $200 from a bank account</p><ol class="postList"><li name="0bf1" id="0bf1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">The system of record approves the transaction and publishes an event to the message bus recording this transaction.</li><li name="0283" id="0283" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">A fraud detection service can analyze the transaction out of band to characterize the likelihood frequently and notifying the bank if it looks suspect.</li><li name="aecb" id="aecb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Simultaneously a push notification can be sent to a mobile phone app notifying the customer of successful completion of the transaction</li><li name="4dda" id="4dda" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">A record of this transaction can be sent to a database warehousing service which can then generate end of month summaries of spending.</li></ol><p name="6e74" id="6e74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">All of this can happen concurrently and in a de-coupled way. Services can be scaled independently, changes can be rolled out and only affect the single microservice which is being updated.</p><p name="457e" id="457e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Transaction two: A customer requests a withdrawal of $3000 which the SoR is deemed to require further authorization…</strong></p><p name="033a" id="033a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this example, the SoR gets a request to transfer a large amount of money. Business logic has been added to the SoR to ensure that this has secondary approval before releasing the funds.</p><p name="58ee" id="58ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this example, the same Event Message Bus can be used but with different outcomes. The format of the event can indicate that this transaction is actually “In Progress” versus “Complete”. In effect, the Microservices could take the following actions:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="61e1" id="61e1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Fraud Detection will review the transaction to see if it has characteristics of scam and notify the bank security team in real-time if this looks suspicious. This could prevent it from being completed.</li><li name="d673" id="d673" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The Push notification app can send a message highlight that this has been requested — but not approved. The end user could take action if this is not expected.</li><li name="e2e6" id="e2e6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Data warehouse will ignore this event — as it has not successfully completed yet.</li><li name="c442" id="c442" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The OPT Auth application though will generate the one time password which is sent to the customer out-of-band to confirm if this is a legitimate request before proceeding with the transaction.</li></ol><p name="5bd1" id="5bd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Overall, event-driven architecture can help you build more robust, scalable, and flexible systems that can respond to events and changes in the environment in a timely and efficient manner.</p><p name="74f3" id="74f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Before you go — if you’ve got this far you’ve hopefully seen some value in this article.
